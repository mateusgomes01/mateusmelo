I've decided to run my website on [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) from now on so that I can focus more on bringing more content to the web with minimal effort.

I would love to create my own static website generator later, but right now I must prioritize writing and producing useful content as much as possible and I feel like hugo's pre-built structure will serve me right for the time being.

Of course there's a learning curve to it (I'm still learning how to create tags and so on) but as soon as I get the hang of it I'll make sure to avoid the excuses and write more.

Thank you for taking your time reading this small update. I hope that you may find useful and inspiring content on this small website.

Sincerely,
Mateus Melo
